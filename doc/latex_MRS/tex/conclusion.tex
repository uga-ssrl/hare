\subsection{Future Work}

Even though the testing framework was not the overall goal of this research,
it turned out to be one of the strong suits of the project. Future work would certainly
include iteration on this framework to ensure that it is as easy as possible to
randomly generate maps as well as add any number of any kind of robot. The benefit
of doing this on Gazebo is the ability to emulate robotic agents much closer to the
real world representation than Unity, ARGoS, or any other open source platform
capable of multi-robot simulation.

Another step would ofcourse be iteration of the tested cooperation model on hardware.
This would require much more extraneous simulation to ensure that all edge cases are
covered. To properly do this, the testing framework would have to be iterated as
described above. Due to Gazebo not inherently supporting multimaster network architectures,
there is the possibility that a plugin or new simulation package would need to be
developed.
